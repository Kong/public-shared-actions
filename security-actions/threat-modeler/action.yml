    # Example: MY_APP is a Java application, deployed as a microservice, running as a Docker container on AWS EKS. MY_APP exposes an API, which provides consumers the ability to submit JWT tokens, whose claims are evaluated against a rules engine. MY_APP returns a true/false response, which consumers can use to determine whether the request is authorized or not.
