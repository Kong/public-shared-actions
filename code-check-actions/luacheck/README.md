# Lua Check - Github Action

Luacheck is a static analyzer for Lua. The options for static analysis configuration can be used on the command line, put into a config file or directly into checked files as Lua comments.

This action analyzes all changed lua files using [lunarmodules/luacheck](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luacheck).

This action looks for any `cli` arguments and a deafult `.luacheckrc` config to derive the final configuaration as mentioned in [docs](https://luacheck.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli.html#command-line-options)

The status outcome of the action will depend based on the follwing:

<!-- - Exit code is 0 if no warnings or errors occurred.
- Exit code is 1 if some warnings occurred but there were no syntax errors or invalid inline options.
- Exit code is 2 if there were some syntax errors or invalid inline options.
- Exit code is 3 if some files couldnâ€™t be checked, typically due to an incorrect file name.
- Exit code is 4 if there was a critical error (invalid CLI arguments, config, or cache file). -->
