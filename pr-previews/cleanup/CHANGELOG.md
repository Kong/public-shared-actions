### Breaking changes

* **ci:** 'Release tags' now use 'unscoped' package names
Applications and Package managers using:
- Release Tag names will need update the package names to new format
- Pinned SHA are NOT affected

* feat(release): dry run

* fix(release): remove allow branch config used for dry run
* **release:** - Each project within Public Shared Action is now treated as an independent package.
- Each package will have its own versioned release.
- Releases tag example "@security-actions/scan-docker-image@1.1.0".
- Markdown (.md) files will be ignored when determining changes for releases.
